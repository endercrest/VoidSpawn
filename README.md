or [Bukkit](https://bukkit.org/) to be installed and setup. Once a Spigot
or Bukkit server is setup, drop VoidSpawn.jar into the plugins folder of
the server then restart the server. For details on how to use the plugin
in-game, head over to the VoidSpawn resource page on
[SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/voidspawn.19350/).
